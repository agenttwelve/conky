# Agenttwelve's conky interface
This is my current Conky interface. It is a WIP but can currently be used to detect 1, 2, 4, 8, and 12 core CPUs (This includes threads).
It is currently only capable of checking for Nvidia GPUs or Integrated GPUs.
The install guide is assuming you already have Conky installed and your configuration file located in /etc/conky

# Install
To install, clone the master directory into your Home directory. 
Then enter the directory using cd /conky
Execute the install command by typing ./install.sh
